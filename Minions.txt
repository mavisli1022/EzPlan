Comments:
- The readme seems to tell nothing about what the project is 
  about.
- You just explaining the folder structure, I thought the code
  will be well explained in comments. But that did not happen.
- If you're hosting a demo live on a site, do you mind sharing
  the demo credentials? or do you expect me to sign up?
- During the demo, I felt it was lacking thought in terms of
  how to store timetables of users efficiently for easier
  comparison. I was looking for an explanation in your final
  report. But did not find any.
