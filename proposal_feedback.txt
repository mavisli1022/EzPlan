WHAT:
    Google calendar for class timetables.

POTENTIAL:
    While this sounds like an interesting concept this would be as easy as
    uploading my timetables to my google calendar and sharing them with my
    friends. While this is pretty easy to do the real challenge is to display
    things right. You can make a real difference if you start thinking in terms
    of presenting google calendar in more insightful ways.

NOTES:
    - For the sake of this assignment, I guess it will be really helpful if you
      can skip the user register option (until it's really important). I mean
      there is nothing "fancy" about a signup form and you don't basically learn
      anything new.
    - If you want to use Google/Facebook Login/SSO, make sure to use their
      vanilla oauth APIs without using any 3rd party wrapper.
    - Generally I appreciate the idea of using oauth for authentication as it:
        1. Removes the user management headache, completely.
        2. Helps you to leave the security to the big guys who have learned from
           their mistakes and are constantly updating their security mechanisms.
        3. You always get the latest and correct information about the user.
    - For the major part the proposal only covers on how to get the user onboard.
      I would recommend thinking after what happens when the user is on board.
      How can you compare 2 users and make it visually clear on what they are
      choosing. What happens when you're comparing timetables of 10 users?
    - Think about an efficient data structure to store timetables which can make
      it a breeze to compare them when required.
    - Can comparison help us recommend study partners for the user? (It should be
      a trivial solution and not require anything complex, like ML)

TA Message:
    This is my understanding about the project, you can use this to improve your
    proposal and presentation to explain your project effectively.

Looking forward to meet you guys to discuss this further.

PS: I always love beautifully written, maintainable code that follows standard
    coding style guides. The ideal code actually walks you through itself and is
    efficient at the same time.
